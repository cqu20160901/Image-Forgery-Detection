# Image-Forgery-Detection

* This is my subject project in the university, which is also the platform of the graduation thesis at the end of my bachelor program.

* I and my colleagues have researched on Machine Learning approaches in Forgery Image Detection, under the supervision of Prof.Dr. Thuong Le-Tien (https://sites.google.com/site/thuongtienle/home).

* Our model can detect forged images with high accuracy of 97.11\%, which outperforms conventional methods even current data-driven methods.

* At the present, I just upload our report in the university. In the near future, code will be uploaded.
